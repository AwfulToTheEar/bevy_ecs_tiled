# From v0.5.X to v0.6.X

## Overview

Version 0.6 brings new features such as Tiled world support and tiles colliders aggregation (which should improve performances when working with physics), bugfixes (mostly for infinite maps) and a rework of the API to make it more user-friendly.

For instance, we now use entity-scoped observers for our loading events instead of global ones, so it's easier to work with several maps at the same time.

Code base have also been re-organized to better fit the new world feature, but it should not impact end-users.

## Plugin instanciation

You don't need to manually instanciate the `TilemapPlugin` from `bevy_ecs_tilemap`.
It is now automatically done when adding `TiledMapPlugin` to your application if not already done.

Before :

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs_tiled::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs_tilemap::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        // Main plugin from bevy_ecs_tilemap
        .add_plugins(TilemapPlugin)
        // Main plugin from bevy_ecs_tiled
        .add_plugins(TiledMapPlugin::default());
}
```

After :

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs_tiled::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        // Main plugin from bevy_ecs_tiled:
        // implicitely load bevy_ecs_tilemap main plugin
        .add_plugins(TiledMapPlugin::default());
}
```

## Map loading events

Map loading events have been heavily updated :

- Instead of using a single global observer, we now trigger an entity-scoped observer **and** send a regular event
- Only use "safe" methods to retrieve data from events (no more `unwrap()` internally)
- Store an `AssetId<TiledMap>` instead of a `Handle<TiledMap>` to acces Tiled map data, enforce the fact that we store a weak reference in the event and not a strong one.
- Some fields from the events have been renamed

Before :

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs_tiled::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(TiledMapPlugin::default())
        .add_systems(Startup, startup)
        // Previously, we could only use a global observer
        .add_observer(|trigger: Trigger<TiledMapCreated>, map_asset: Res<Assets<TiledMap>>| {
            // Previously, the method to retrieve map data would panic in case of error
            let map = trigger.event().map(&map_asset);
            info!("(observer) Loaded map: {:?}", map);
        });
}

fn startup(
  mut commands: Commands,
  asset_server: Res<AssetServer>
) {
    commands.spawn(TiledMapHandle(asset_server.load("map.tmx")));
}
```

After :

```rust,no_run
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_ecs_tiled::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(TiledMapPlugin::default())
        .add_systems(Startup, startup)
        .add_systems(Update, read_map_events);
}

fn startup(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    commands
        .spawn(TiledMapHandle(asset_server.load("map.tmx")))
        // Now, you can use an entity-scoped observer
        .observe(
            |trigger: Trigger<TiledMapCreated>, map_asset: Res<Assets<TiledMap>>| {
                // Now, this method return an Option<T> and don't panic in case of error
                if let Some(map) = trigger.event().get_map(&map_asset) {
                    info!("(observer) Loaded map: {:?}", map);
                }
            },
        );
}

// Or a regular event
fn read_map_events(mut map_events: EventReader<TiledMapCreated>, map_asset: Res<Assets<TiledMap>>) {
    for event in map_events.read() {
        if let Some(map) = event.get_map(&map_asset) {
            info!("(event) Loaded map: {:?}", map);
        }
    }
}
```

## Physics

To get tile colliders aggregation working, we had to rework a bit the physics API :

- function `TiledPhysicsBackend::spawn_collider()` can now spawn several colliders per call. To reflect that it now returns a `Vec<TiledColliderSpawnInfos>` instead of an `Option<TiledColliderSpawnInfos>`. Also, it now takes a `TiledNameFilter` as input parameter to filter out unwanted objects
- remove the `TiledColliderCreated` events which added some complexity but did not have actual usage
- rename `TiledColliderSourceType` to `TiledCollider` and remove the `Tile` variant in favor of the new `TilesLayer`
- `TiledPhysicsBackend` now requires to implement the `Clone`, `Reflect` and `Debug` traits
- rename Rename `ObjectNameFilter` to `TiledNameFilter` since we also use it for layer name

## Schedules

To prevent potential Bevy error [B0003](https://bevyengine.org/learn/errors/b0003/) we changed a bit how our systems are scheduled.

Before, everything was done in the `Update` schedule.
Now, we schedule systems that spawn entities in the `PreUpdate` schedule and systems that could despawn entities in the `PostUpdate` schedule.

## Misc API changes

- rename `TiledIdStorage` component to `TiledMapStorage` so we are consistent with the new world API
- rename `ObjectNameFilter` type to `TiledNameFilter` since we also use it for layer names
- rename `from_tiled_coords_to_bevy` function to `from_tiled_position_to_world_space`
- split `TiledMapSettings` component in two: `TiledMapAnchor` and `TiledMapLayerZOffset`
